<h1>Foreword</h1>
<p>There can’t be anyone, I am sure, who doesn’t know what it
feels like to be disliked, even rejected, momentarily or for sustained
periods of time. Perhaps the feeling is merely indifference,
mild annoyance, but it may also be hurt. It may even be
that some of us know what it is like to be actually hated—
hated for things we have no control over and cannot change.
When this happens, it is some consolation to know that the
dislike or hatred is unjustified—that you don’t deserve it. And
if you have the emotional strength and/or support from family
and friends, the damage is reduced or erased. We think of it as
the stress (minor or disabling) that is part of life as a human.</p>
